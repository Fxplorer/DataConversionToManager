# DataConversionToManager

Manager.IO is an accounting program that, while not open source, is free to use for the desktop as a single user. 

They offer a hosted plan for about $60 (December 2023) which allows multi-user logins and also allows unlimited business files. This lends itself to just creating a new business to use for testing and trials and such. 

Manager lets you export data and then paste in data to do bulk updates and creations.
